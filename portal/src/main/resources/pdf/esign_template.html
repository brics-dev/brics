	<p>The system uses electronic documentation which may require you to provide an electronic signature when you enter, submit, change, access, download, or audit electronic data records.</p>
	<p><strong>ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE.</strong>&nbsp; This Acknowledgement and Certification of Understanding ("Acknowledgement") is to inform you that by submitting an electronic signature, you are providing an electronic mark that is held to the same standard as a legally binding equivalent of a handwritten signature provided by you.&nbsp; For purposes of the acknowledgement, a digital mark is considered your legally typed First and Last Name (legal name may include middle name, initial or suffix) followed by your password. A date will be recorded with both entries.&nbsp; Any part of the system requiring an electronic signature may contain a signature acknowledgment statement provided in the same area requiring the electronic signature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>AGREEMENT:</strong> By signing this Acknowledgement, I agree that my electronic signature is the legally binding equivalent to my handwritten signature.&nbsp; Whenever I execute an electronic signature, it has the same validity and meaning as my handwritten signature.&nbsp; I will not, at any time in the future, repudiate the meaning of my electronic signature or claim that my electronic signature is not legally binding. I also understand that it is a violation for any individual to sign/e-sign any transactions that occur within the system on behalf of me. Any fraudulent activities related to electronic signatures must be immediately reported to the system operations team. Violation of these terms could lead to disciplinary action, up to termination, and prosecution under applicable Federal laws.</p>
	<p><strong>CERTIFICATION OF UNDERSTANDING:</strong>&nbsp; I also understand, acknowledge, agree and certify that:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>I accept my responsibilities in the use of electronic signatures as described on this form.</li>
	<li>My execution of any form of an electronic signature function performed on the system to be the legally binding equivalent of my traditional handwritten signature, and that I am accountable and responsible for actions performed under such an electronic signature.</li>
	<li>I will not share components of my electronic signature such that my signature could be executed by another individual. Such components may include but are not limited to legal name, passwords or any such identifiers.</li>
