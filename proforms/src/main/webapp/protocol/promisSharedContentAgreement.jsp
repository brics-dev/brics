	<h3>TERMS OF USE</h3>
	<p>PROMIS TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /> You understand and agree that the PROMIS Health Organization and PROMIS Cooperative Group provides access to PROMIS instruments (e.g., item banks, short forms, profile measures) subject to the PROMIS Terms and Conditions (PTAC). The PROMIS Health Organization/Cooperative Group reserves the right to update the PTAC at any time. Changes in the PTAC will apply to new users, new instruments and to new projects created by existing users after these changes are posted. The most current version of the PTAC can be reviewed by clicking on the Terms of Use hypertext link located in Assessment Center.&nbsp;<br /> PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE LIMITATION.<br /> PROMIS instruments measuring self-reported fatigue, pain, physical function, social function, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, and global health are available for adult and pediatric samples. Additionally, an item bank and short form for measuring impact of asthma in pediatric samples is available. These tools were developed in the English language using extensive qualitative methods to ensure conceptual and semantic clarity. They have been tested for reliability and comparability to more established measures of these same content areas. Adult testing in over 20,000 individuals from the United States (U.S.) general population has resulted in individual item calibrations that enable one to generate a T-score (mean=50; standard deviation = 10) based on a sample of people in the general U.S. population. Included in this first wave of PROMIS item testing were several clinical samples. Child and youth testing in over 4,000 individuals from the United States (U.S.) general pediatric clinical population has resulted in individual item calibrations that enable one to generate a T-score (mean=50; standard deviation = 10) based on a sample of children in the U.S. general pediatric clinical population. The item calibrations and test statistics provided are all based upon cross-sectional data collection. PROMIS item banks have not yet been tested longitudinally in clinical or non-clinical samples; therefore information on the responsiveness of PROMIS item banks is unavailable. Their use in clinical research is encouraged, with the understanding that data collected from that use will contribute to knowledge about the validity of PROMIS measures. Therefore, until validity data are more mature, USERS OF PROMIS TOOLS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT A BRIEF REPORT INCLUDING SAMPLE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, CLINICAL DATA SUFFICIENT TO DEFINE THE SAMPLE WITHOUT INDICATING TREATMENT RESPONSE DATA, AND PROMIS SCORE DISTRIBUTIONS (E.G., BASELINE MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS OR CHANGE SCORES BLINDED TO TREATMENT INFORMATION). This brief report should be submitted to help@assessmentcenter.net for internal review. None of this submitted information will be published without the written consent and participation of the submitter. In addition to the brief report, clinical researchers are encouraged to submit de-identified data for collaborative analysis and reporting. Data ownership would remain with the submitter. Clinical researchers are strongly encouraged to collaborate with PROMIS investigators when applying these items and banks to their research.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> ANY PUBLICATION OR PRESENTATION OF RESULTS OBTAINED FROM STUDIES CONDUCTED USING THESE INSTRUMENTS SHOULD INCLUDE A STATEMENT THAT PROMIS VERSION X INSTRUMENTS WERE USED, AND REFERENCE THE PROMIS SITE (WWW.NIHPROMIS.ORG) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.<br /> <br /> PERMISSION TO USE PROMIS INSTRUMENTS DOES NOT GRANT PERMISSION TO MODIFY THE WORDING OR LAYOUT OF ITEMS, TO DISTRIBUTE TO OTHERS FOR A FEE, OR TO TRANSLATE ITEMS INTO ANY OTHER LANGUAGE. SUCH PERMISSION TO MODIFY, DISTRIBUTE, OR TRANSLATE MUST BE REQUESTED FROM THE PROMIS HEALTH ORGANIZATION OR THE OWNER OF THE COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS FROM WHICH PROMIS HAS BEEN DERIVED.<br /> COPYRIGHT NOTICE AND CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.<br /> Information and materials contained herein are &copy;2010 PROMIS Health Organization or other individuals/entities that have contributed information and materials to Assessment Center, and are being used with the permission of the copyright holders.<br /> The table set forth below identifies individuals and entities who have contributed items in support of building PROMIS item banks and the copyrighted information and materials employed by such persons. As a user of PROMIS you are entirely responsible for respecting the proprietary rights of such persons, and for complying strictly with the requirements set forth herein. If you have questions about these requirements and your legal obligations, you may wish to consult an attorney.&nbsp;
